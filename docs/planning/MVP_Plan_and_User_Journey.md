# üìö Bookshelf Scanner - Comprehensive MVP Plan & User Journey Analysis

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Bookshelf Scanner is a revolutionary iOS app that transforms physical book collections into digital libraries using AI-powered image recognition. This MVP plan focuses on the core bookshelf scanning experience with a streamlined 4-tab architecture designed for optimal user engagement and library management.

## üèóÔ∏è Initial Technical Architecture Plan

## Overview
A SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to scan bookshelves using the device camera, extract book information via Gemini Vision AI API, and organize them into a digital library with "Currently Reading" and "Library" sections.

## Core Requirements
- Camera integration for bookshelf scanning
- Image analysis using Gemini Vision API
- Book data extraction (title, author, etc.)
- Local storage and organization
- Minimal-effort user experience

## Architecture
### Design Pattern: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Model**: Data structures and business logic
- **View**: SwiftUI views for UI
- **ViewModel**: State management and API interactions

### Key Components
1. **Data Models**
   - `Book`: Core entity with book information
   - `BookStatus`: Enum for reading status
   - `ScanResult`: API response structure

2. **Services**
   - `CameraService`: Handles camera operations
   - `GeminiAPIService`: Manages API calls to Gemini Vision
   - `PersistenceService`: Core Data operations

3. **Views**
   - `ScannerView`: Camera interface
   - `LibraryView`: Book collection display
   - `BookDetailView`: Individual book information
   - `MainTabView`: Tab navigation

## Data Models

### Book Model
```swift
struct Book: Identifiable, Codable {
    var id = UUID()
    var title: String
    var author: String
    var isbn: String?
    var genre: String?
    var status: BookStatus
    var dateAdded: Date
    var coverImageData: Data?
}

enum BookStatus: String, Codable {
    case library
    case currentlyReading
}
```

### API Response Model
```swift
struct GeminiResponse: Codable {
    let candidates: [Candidate]
}

struct Candidate: Codable {
    let content: Content
}

struct Content: Codable {
    let parts: [Part]
}

struct Part: Codable {
    let text: String
}
```

## API Integration
### Gemini Vision API
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro-vision:generateContent`
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Parameters:
  - `key`: API key
  - Image file
  - Prompt: "Extract book titles, authors, and other details from this bookshelf image. Return as JSON."

## Persistence
- **Framework**: Core Data
- **Entities**:
  - BookEntity (mirrors Book struct)
- **Operations**: CRUD for books, status updates

## UI Flow
```
App Launch ‚Üí MainTabView
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library Tab ‚Üí LibraryView (List of books)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scan Button ‚Üí ScannerView
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Book Row ‚Üí BookDetailView
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Currently Reading Tab ‚Üí CurrentlyReadingView
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scan Button ‚Üí ScannerView
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Book Row ‚Üí BookDetailView
```

## Permissions Required
Add to Info.plist:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan bookshelves</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to save book cover images</string>
```

## Error Handling

- Network connectivity issues

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for data models and services
- UI tests for main flows
- Integration tests for API calls

## Dependencies
