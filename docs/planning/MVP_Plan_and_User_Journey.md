# 📚 Book Shelfie - Comprehensive MVP Plan & User Journey Analysis

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The Book Shelfie is a revolutionary iOS app that transforms physical book collections into digital libraries using AI-powered image recognition. This MVP plan focuses on the core bookshelf scanning experience with a streamlined 4-tab architecture designed for optimal user engagement and library management.

## 🏗️ Initial Technical Architecture Plan

## Overview
A SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to scan bookshelves using the device camera, extract book information via Gemini Vision AI API, and organize them into a digital library with "Currently Reading" and "Library" sections.

## Core Requirements
- Camera integration for bookshelf scanning
- Image analysis using Gemini Vision API
- Book data extraction (title, author, etc.)
- Local storage and organization
- Minimal-effort user experience

## Architecture
### Design Pattern: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Model**: Data structures and business logic
- **View**: SwiftUI views for UI
- **ViewModel**: State management and API interactions

### Key Components
1. **Data Models**
   - `Book`: Core entity with book information
   - `BookStatus`: Enum for reading status
   - `ScanResult`: API response structure

2. **Services**
   - `CameraService`: Handles camera operations
   - `GeminiAPIService`: Manages API calls to Gemini Vision
   - `PersistenceService`: Core Data operations

3. **Views**
   - `ScannerView`: Camera interface
   - `LibraryView`: Book collection display
   - `BookDetailView`: Individual book information
   - `MainTabView`: Tab navigation

## Data Models

### Book Model
```swift
struct Book: Identifiable, Codable {
    var id = UUID()
    var title: String
    var author: String
    var isbn: String?
    var genre: String?
    var status: BookStatus
    var dateAdded: Date
    var coverImageData: Data?
}

enum BookStatus: String, Codable {
    case library
    case currentlyReading
}
```

### API Response Model
```swift
struct GeminiResponse: Codable {
    let candidates: [Candidate]
}

struct Candidate: Codable {
    let content: Content
}

struct Content: Codable {
    let parts: [Part]
}

struct Part: Codable {
    let text: String
}
```

## API Integration
### Gemini Vision API
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro-vision:generateContent`
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Parameters:
  - `key`: API key
  - Image file
  - Prompt: "Extract book titles, authors, and other details from this bookshelf image. Return as JSON."

## Persistence
- **Framework**: Core Data
- **Entities**:
  - BookEntity (mirrors Book struct)
- **Operations**: CRUD for books, status updates

## UI Flow
```
App Launch → MainTabView
├── Library Tab → LibraryView (List of books)
│   ├── Scan Button → ScannerView
│   └── Book Row → BookDetailView
└── Currently Reading Tab → CurrentlyReadingView
    ├── Scan Button → ScannerView
    └── Book Row → BookDetailView
```

## Permissions Required
Add to Info.plist:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan bookshelves</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to save book cover images</string>
```

## Error Handling

- URLSession (built-in)

## Implementation Phases
1. Project setup and permissions
2. Data models and persistence
3. Camera integration
4. API service implementation
5. UI development
6. Integration and testing

## 🎨 **LIQUID GLASS DESIGN SYSTEM FOR 4-TAB STRUCTURE**

### **Tab-Specific Design Applications**

#### **📚 Library Tab Design**
```swift
struct LibraryTabColors {
    static let scanButton = UIGradients.primaryButton // Prominent pink-purple gradient
    static let bookCards = CardStyles.bookCard() // Glass effect with status indicators
    static let statusIndicators = [
        "toRead": AccentColors.cyberBlue,
        "reading": AccentColors.sunsetOrange, 
        "read": AccentColors.electricLime
    ]
    static let searchBar = FormStyles.textField() // Glass input with focus states
}
```

#### **📖 Reading Tab Design**
```swift
struct ReadingTabColors {
    static let progressRings = ReadingProgressColors.progressRingColor // Dynamic based on completion
    static let activeBookCards = CardStyles.bookCard() // Enhanced glass for active books
    static let completeButton = SemanticColors.successPrimary // Green completion action
    static let sessionTracking = PrimaryColors.vibrantPurple // Purple accent for time tracking
}
```

#### **🤖 Discover Tab Design**
```swift
struct DiscoverTabColors {
    static let recommendationCards = CardStyles.recommendationCard() // Pink-tinted glass
    static let categoryFilters = UIGradients.secondaryButton // Turquoise-green gradient
    static let addToLibraryButton = UIGradients.primaryButton // Primary action gradient
    static let grokAIBranding = AccentColors.hotMagenta // Distinct AI service branding
}
```

#### **👤 Profile Tab Design**
```swift
struct ProfileTabColors {
    static let headerBackground = BackgroundGradients.profileGradient // Lavender-coral-orange
    static let statisticsCards = UIGradients.cardBackground // Glass analytics cards
    static let settingsBackground = AdaptiveColors.secondaryBackground // Adaptive theme support
    static let avatarBorder = AccentColors.hotMagenta // Pink profile picture border
}
```
