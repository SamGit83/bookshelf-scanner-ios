## ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive Implementation Plan

### 1. Step-by-Step Feature Additions

#### Backend User Tiers
1. Define `UserTier` enum in Swift with cases: `free`, `premium`.
2. Extend the `User` model struct to include `tier: UserTier` and `subscriptionId: String?`.
3. Update `AuthService` to fetch user tier from Firestore on login.
4. Add Firestore security rules to allow users to read/write their own tier.
5. Create API functions for updating user tier based on subscription status.

#### UI Limits Implementation
1. Create a `UsageTracker` singleton class to track monthly scans, books count, recommendations.
2. Implement limit checking functions: `canPerformScan()`, `canAddBook()`, `canGetRecommendation()`.
3. Modify `CameraView` to check limits before scanning and show upgrade prompt if exceeded.
4. Update `AddBookView` to enforce book limit.
5. Add usage display in `ProfileView` showing current vs limits.
6. Implement upgrade prompt dialogs with navigation to subscription screen.
7. Update signup page to display tier options (free and premium) and allow users to select a tier during signup - include UI updates to signup flow for tier selection and backend integration to set initial user tier based on selection.

#### Payment Integration
1. Integrate RevenueCat SDK for iOS subscription management.
2. Configure products in App Store Connect: monthly ($2.99) and annual ($29.99) subscriptions.
3. Create `SubscriptionView` for purchasing and managing subscriptions.
4. Handle purchase flow: initiate purchase, validate receipt, update user tier.
5. Implement subscription status listener to update tier on renew/cancel.
6. Add restore purchases functionality.

### 2. Testing Plan

#### Unit Tests
- Test `UserTier` enum and model extensions.
- Test `UsageTracker` calculations and limit checks.
- Test `AuthService` tier fetching and updating.
- Test payment status parsing and tier updates.

#### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end scan flow with limit enforcement.
- Test subscription purchase and tier upgrade.
- Test API calls for user data with tier restrictions.
- Test offline functionality with cached limits.

#### User Acceptance Testing
- Recruit 50-100 beta users for testing.
- Provide test scenarios: reaching limits, upgrading, downgrading.
- Collect feedback via in-app surveys and bug reports.
- Iterate on UI/UX based on feedback before full release.

### 3. Migration Strategy

#### Existing Users
- Run a one-time migration script via Firebase Admin SDK to add `'tier': 'free'` to all user documents.
- Send push notification or in-app message announcing the freemium model.
- Update onboarding to explain tiers.

#### Data Handling
- Ensure existing user data remains intact; no deletions or modifications.
- Verify offline cache works with new limit logic.
- Test data export/import for premium features.

### 4. Rollout Phases

- Test payment edge cases (refunds, cancellations).

#### Phase 3: Testing and QA (Weeks 5-6)
- Complete unit and integration tests.
- Perform security audit for payment data.
- Conduct internal QA testing.

#### Phase 4: Beta Release (Weeks 7-8)
- Release to beta testers via TestFlight.
- Monitor crash reports and user feedback.
- Fix critical issues.

#### Phase 5: Full Rollout (Week 9)
- Submit to App Store for review.
- Go live with monitoring in place.
- Prepare rollback plan if needed.

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics Setup

#### Firebase Analytics Implementation
- Enable Firebase Analytics in the app.
- Log custom events: `scan_performed`, `limit_reached`, `upgrade_prompt_shown`, `subscription_purchased`, `subscription_cancelled`.
- Track user properties: `user_tier`, `subscription_status`.

#### Key Metrics Dashboard
- Set up Firebase Console dashboards for real-time metrics.
- Monitor conversion funnel: free users -> upgrade prompt -> purchase.
- Track usage patterns: scans per user, books added, recommendations requested.
- Monitor costs: API usage vs revenue.

#### Alerts and Monitoring
