- 🤖 **AI-Powered Recognition**: Extract book details using Gemini 1.5 Flash (latest model)
- 👥 **Multi-User Support**: Firebase authentication and cloud sync
- 📚 **Digital Library**: Organize books into Library and Currently Reading
- 🔄 **Cross-Device Sync**: Access your library on all devices
- 🎯 **Smart Recommendations**: Personalized book suggestions based on reading patterns
- 📊 **Reading Progress Tracking**: Log reading sessions and set goals
- ⚡ **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet connection
- 🔍 **Advanced Search**: Find books by title, author, genre, or ISBN

## 🤖 AI Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash

This app uses **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash** - the most advanced multimodal AI model for image analysis:

### **Key Improvements Over Previous Models:**
- **📈 2x Faster Processing**: ~1-2 seconds per image analysis
- **🎯 Superior OCR**: Better text recognition from curved book spines
- **💰 5x More Cost Effective**: Lower API costs per request
- **🔍 Enhanced Accuracy**: Improved small text recognition (ISBNs)
- **🌍 Better Language Support**: Multi-language book recognition
- **⚡ Higher Rate Limits**: 1000 requests/minute vs 60

### **Advanced Capabilities:**
- Curved and angled text recognition
- Small print extraction (ISBN, publisher info)
- Genre inference from cover design
- Book condition assessment
- Confidence scoring for extractions
- Multi-book detection in single images

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration

1. **Create Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Create a project" or select existing project
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore Database

2. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider

3. **Set up Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firestore Database → Create database
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (you can change security rules later)

4. **Download Configuration**:
   - Go to Project settings → General → Your apps
   - Click "Add app" → iOS
   - Enter your bundle ID (can be anything, e.g., `com.yourname.bookshelfscanner`)
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Replace the placeholder file in `Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist`

### 2. Gemini API Configuration

1. **Get API Key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key

2. **Update API Key**:
   - Open `Sources/GeminiAPIService.swift`
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key

### 3. Google Books API Configuration (for recommendations)

1. **Enable Google Books API**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing
   - Enable the "Google Books API"
   - Create credentials (API Key)

2. **Update API Key**:
   - Open `Sources/GoogleBooksAPIService.swift`
   - Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY"` with your actual API key

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
swift package resolve

# Build the app
swift build

# For Xcode integration, you may need to:
# 1. Open the project in Xcode
# 2. Add the GoogleService-Info.plist to your Xcode project
# 3. Ensure all Firebase frameworks are linked
```

## App Architecture

### Core Components

- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for user management
- **Database**: Firestore for cloud storage with real-time sync
- **AI Service**: Gemini Vision API for book recognition
- **Local Storage**: UserDefaults for offline caching
- **UI**: SwiftUI with MVVM architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: User signs up/logs in via Firebase Auth
2. **Camera Capture**: User scans bookshelf with device camera
3. **AI Processing**: Image sent to Gemini API for book extraction
4. **Data Storage**: Books saved to user's Firestore collection
5. **Sync**: Real-time sync across all user devices

### Security

- User-specific data isolation in Firestore
- Firebase Authentication for secure access
- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure API key management

## Usage

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create account or sign in
2. **Scan Books**: Point camera at bookshelf and capture
3. **View Library**: Browse your digitized book collection
4. **Organize**: Move books between Library and Currently Reading
5. **Sync**: Access your library on any device
6. **Discover**: Get personalized book recommendations based on your reading patterns

## Firebase Structure
